# Handwriting Classification Using Deep Learning and Machine Learning

***This repository contains a project on Handwriting Classification using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. The goal of this project is to accurately classify handwritten characters into their respective classes.***
<br />
## Project Overview
<p>Handwriting recognition is a challenging task in the field of pattern recognition and machine learning. In this project, we explore two different approaches to tackle this problem: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Additionally, we combine these two models to create a hybrid/composite model for improved accuracy.</p>

## Features
* Utilizes popular libraries such as pandas, numpy, opencv, matplotlib, sklearn, keras, tensorflow, imutils, seaborn, and more.<br />
* Includes two main models: KNN and CNN, along with a hybrid model combining the strengths of both approaches.<br />
* Provides a comprehensive training and testing pipeline for each model.<br />
* Achieved an accuracy of 88.017% using the KNN algorithm, 94.6% using the CNN algorithm, and an impressive 94.83% with the hybrid model.<br />
* Offers flexibility to experiment with hyperparameters and tweak the models for better performance.<br />
